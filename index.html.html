 <h2>Welcome to my Life before you know me</h2>
    <p>I am Charles Q. Salazar, I live in Maranding Lala Lanao Del Norte
    Philippines. I am currently a student at Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology
    taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Applications. I love to play games, watch anime, and listening to music.

  <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>I was born on September 28, 2007, in Manila Quezon City Taft Avenue in Philippine General Hospital. I am the eldest child
    among my siblings. Since I was a kid I always love to play games and watch cartoons. My favorite cartoon when I was a kid
    is Team Umizoomi. I also love to play outside with my friends. I always tend to sing back when I was younger and listen music. 
    I was spoiled as a kid because I am the eldest child because my grandparents always give me what I want.

    <h3>My Education Achievements</h3>
       <p>In my Elementary days in Bible Baptist Christian Academy I was an outstanding student I always get a grade of 94-98
        and always be in the top 5 of my class. I also joined some competitions like Junior Studnet Convention in our schooland
        and I also participatd in MTAP competitions. In my High School days in Lala National Higschool my grades were not that good
        as in my elementary days I couldn't get a grade of 90 above because I always get distracted by playing online games and also being lazy to even learn. 
        I couldn't get to top of my classes anymore but I still manage to pass my subjects. Now that I'm in college also in the most prestigious university in Mindanao
        Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology I will do my best to get good and not recall my past mistakes in high school and strive to be better. 
        but unfortunately because of the pandemic my first year in college was a struggle for me because I couldn't adapt to how the learnin system works here in MSU-IIT
        because of my laziness and procrastination I couldn't manage to focus on my subjects. But I will do my best to improve my grades this coming semesters.

    <h6>My Favourite Quote</h6>
         <h8>"The value of a person is written in their character, not their appearance."
         </h8>
         <p>A person's true worth comes from how they act their honesty, kindness, and integrity not from how they look on the outside. 
            Physical appearance can change, but character shows who someone really is in moments of pressure, difficulty, and choice.
            When we judge people by their character instead of their looks, we see their real value and understand them more deeply.
